      <img  src="assets/images/profilepic.jpg" class="auth-image imagescale" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Welcome to my portfolio.  Over the past 9 years, I have pursued and succeeded at a career in Media Distribution and enjoyed a position as a Broadcast Systems Engineer with multiple high end Network Including NBC, ABC, NFL Network, Root Sports, Scripps and KATZ Networks. I have been tasked with ensuring the clean and correct playout of all of the networks during high volume events such as the olympics and Thursday Night Football.</p>

      <p>My time in Engineering has given me an immense respect for software development and inspired me to pursue a new career to further pursue.  I am currently attending the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp to assist in that goal and confidentally tackle any problem thrown my way. </p>
